# flutter_app1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.


This application generates cool-sounding names, such as "newstay", "lightstream", "mainbrake", or "graypine".
Users can ask for the next name, favorite the current one, and review the list of favorite names on a separate page. 
The app is responsive for different screen sizes.
